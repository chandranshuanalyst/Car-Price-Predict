# Car-Price-Prediction
In this project ,we have given car price and some features affecting price and we have built a linear regression model to determine the price of car.

The features(or independent variables) are :
1)Brand
2)Body.
3)Mileage
4)EngineV
5)Engine Type
6)Registration	
7)Year
8)Model

The dependent variable is PRICE

The data has 4345 row or entries.

What is done in the project?
1)Identification of missing values and their treatment
2)Treatment of outliers in features.
3)Adjusting price so that features and modified price is linearly related.
4)Modifying categorical variables and making dummy variables
5)Check for presence of multicollinearity using VIF and treatment
6)Standardising features and applying train test split.
7)Applying linear regression to the entire dataset to get a model.

The final model Mse is 0.384 and R squared is approximately 62%
