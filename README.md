# Car-Price-Prediction
In this project ,we have given car price and some features affecting price and we have built a linear regression model to determine the price of car.

The features(or independent variables) are :<br/>
1)Brand<br/>
2)Body<br/>
3)Mileage<br/>
4)EngineV<br/>
5)Engine Type<br/>
6)Registration<br/>
7)Year<br/>
8)Model<br/>

The dependent variable is PRICE

The data has 4345 row or entries in the dataset.

What is done in the project?<br/>
1)Identification of missing values and their treatment.<br/>
2)Treatment of outliers in features.<br/>
3)Adjusting price so that features and modified price is linearly related.<br/>
4)Modifying categorical variables and making dummy variables.<br/>
5)Check for presence of multicollinearity using VIF and treatment.<br/>
6)Standardising features and applying train test split.<br/>
7)Applying linear regression to the entire dataset to get a model.

The final model Mse is 0.384 and R squared is approximately 62%
