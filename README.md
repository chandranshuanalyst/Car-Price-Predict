# Car-Price-Prediction
In this project ,we have given car price and some features affecting price and we have built a linear regression model to determine the price of car.

### The features(or independent variables) are :<br/>
1. Brand<br/>
2. Body<br/>
3. Mileage<br/>
4. EngineV<br/>
5. Engine Type<br/>
6. Registration<br/>
7. Year<br/>
8. Model<br/>

The dependent variable is PRICE (of car)

The data has 4345 row or entries in the dataset.

### What is done in the project?<br/>
* Identification of missing values and their treatment.<br/>
* Treatment of outliers in features.<br/>
* Adjusting price so that features and modified price is linearly related.<br/>
* Modifying categorical variables and making dummy variables.<br/>
* Check for presence of multicollinearity using VIF and treatment.<br/>
* Standardising features and applying train test split.<br/>
* Applying linear regression to the entire dataset to get a model.

The final model Mse is 0.384 and R squared is approximately 62%
